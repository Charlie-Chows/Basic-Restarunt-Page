# Basic-Restarunt-Page

I built this for those who want to build projects or basic templates using only HTML. It will be more helpful.

This page has the basic structure of HTML. It contains most of the frequently used tags and semantic tags.

It is used to refer to HTML tags in a short amount of time.
